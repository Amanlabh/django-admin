# Assignment Using Django

This repository contains the code for the Django-based assignment. Follow the instructions below to set up the project locally and run the server.

## 1. Clone the Repository

To clone this repository on your local machine, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amanlabh/assignment-using-Django.git  # Clone the repository
cd assignment-using-Django  # Navigate to the project directory
2. Set Up Your Django Project Locally
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. 
```
For Linux/MacOS, run:
```bash
python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
```
```bash
For Windows, run:


python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment
Install Dependencies
After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies:

```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install project dependencies
```
3. Run the Django Development Server
Once the environment is set up, you can run the Django development server with the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver  # Start the Django server
The development server will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can visit this URL in your browser to view the project.
```

4. Access the Django Admin Panel
To access the Django Admin Panel, you need to create a superuser account. Run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser  # Create a superuser account
```
Follow the prompts to set up the admin credentials (username, email, and password).

After creating the superuser, you can access the admin panel at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

Log in with the superuser credentials you just created.

5. Additional Notes
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+).
If you face any issues during setup, make sure all dependencies are correctly installed.
